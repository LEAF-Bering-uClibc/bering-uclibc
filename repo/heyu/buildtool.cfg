		Help <<EOF
		HEYU is a text-based console program for remotely controlling lights and appliances in the home or office.
		Heyu uses the CM11A computer interface to send and receive X10 control signals over the AC power lines 
		to modules which can turn On, Off, or Dim attached lamps or appliances.
		It can store a schedule of timed events in the CM11A memory for execution when the computer is turned off 
		or disconnected.
		Heyu supports an optional W800RF32A, MR26A, or RFXCOM RF receiver connected to a second port as an auxiliary 
		input device for RF signals from X10 and other supported transmitters.
		Heyu can also use an optional CM17A interface to transmit X10 RF signals.
