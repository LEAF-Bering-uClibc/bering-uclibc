		'ndppd', or NDP Proxy Daemon, is a daemon that proxies NDP (Neighbor
		Discovery Protocol) messages between interfaces.

		The Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) is a protocol in the Internet
		Protocol Suite used with Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6). It
		operates in the Link Layer of the Internet model (RFC 1122) and is
		responsible for address autoconfiguration of nodes, discovery of
		other nodes on the link, determining the Link Layer addresses
		of other nodes, duplicate address detection, finding available
		routers and Domain Name System (DNS) servers, address prefix
		discovery, and maintaining reachability information about the paths
		to other active neighbor nodes (RFC 4861). (Wikipedia)
