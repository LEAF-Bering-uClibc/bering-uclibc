		Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, that will appear in the
		GNU operating system. Bash is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful
		features from the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell (csh).
		It is intended to conform to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and
		Tools standard. It offers functional improvements over sh for both programming
		and interactive use.
		In addition, most sh scripts can be run by Bash without modification.
