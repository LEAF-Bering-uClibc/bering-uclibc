		    dhcp-helper is a DHCP and BOOTP relay agent. 
		    It listens for DHCP and BOOTP broadcasts on directly connected 
		    subnets and relays them to DHCP or BOOTP servers elsewhere. 
		    It also relays replies from the remote servers back to partially 
		    configured hosts. Once hosts are fully configured they can 
		    communicate directly with their servers and no longer need the 
		    services of a relay.
