		Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder and 
		DHCP server. It is designed to provide DNS and, optionally, 
		DHCP, to a small network. It can serve the names of local 
		machines which are not in the global DNS. The DHCP server 
		integrates with the DNS server and allows machines with 
		DHCP-allocated addresses to appear in the DNS with names 
		configured either in each host or in a central configuration 
		file. Dnsmasq support static and dynamic DHCP leases and BOOTP 
		for network booting of diskless machines.
		Dnsmasq is targeted at home networks using NAT routers and 
		connected via modem, cable-modem or ADSL connection.
