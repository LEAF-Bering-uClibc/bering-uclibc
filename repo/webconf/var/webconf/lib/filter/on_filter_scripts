Let us say that Bering uses log files with elementary names
according to this list:

	auth.log	messages
	cron.log	mini_httpd.log
	daemon.log	shorewall.log
	debug		syslog
	mail.log	ulogd.log
			user.log

They get extensions 	0  1.gz  2.gz  and so on.


The webconf-script logfiles.cgi in this test package
contructs a new subdirectory

	/var/webconf/lib/filter/

which collects executables that take stdin as input and
transforms it in someway to produce output at stdout.
In oder to be accepted by any file in this directory
must be executable and carry a name according to the 
principle

	"elementary name of log file" . "arbitrary extension"

and three examples are in this package:

	daemon.log.show.request-ack

	debug.only.REQUEST

	messages.non-MARK

There will be entries under "specialized viewing" when the new
webconf page logfiles.cgi is summond to reflect filters like those
just described, but not with such clumsy names. Instead there will
be entries

	show.request-ack	for	daemon.log  daemon.log.0 ...

	only.REQUEST		for	debug  debug.0  debug.1.gz ...

	non-MARK		for	messages  messages.0 ...

that work like the old entry "view" did, but now the text is
preprocessed with a filter according to your desires before
being sent back to your workstation for viewing in the browser.
