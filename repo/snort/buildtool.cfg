		Snort is a lightweight intrusion detection system designed to
		sniff packets coming into and out of your network for various
		signatures. It logs the packets it finds to alert you to possible
		intrusion attempts into your network. It also is a very powerful
		packet sniffer and packet logger for people interested in finding
		out what all is being transmitted over their network.
