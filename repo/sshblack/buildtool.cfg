      Utility to automatically BLACKlist SSH attackers (or any other attackers)
      based on repeated log messages such as "Bad password attempt".
      Can be configured to watch any log file for any regex string and
      temporarily block the offending source IP (v4 only) address using
      Shorewall's dynamic blacklisting facility (actually it can run any shell
      command you wish but by default it is configured to run "shorewall drop").
