		<p>In this section you can find a list of packages available for Bering uClibc 4.0 beta3
		These packages are mostly derived from the original Berinug-uClibc 3.1.1 LRP's, where the 
		programs in those packages are upgraded from their latest sources (and patches) and rebuilt 
		against uClibc-0.9.30.3.</p>
		<p><strong>Please note: These packages are only for Bering-uClibc versions 4.0 and above.</strong>
