# if your Shorewall configuration requires detection of the ip address of a ppp
# interface, you must list such interfaces in "wait_interface" to get Shorewall
# wait until the interface is configured. Otherwise the script will fail because
# it won't be able to detect the IP address.
#
# Example:
#    wait_interface="ppp0"
# or
#    wait_interface="ppp0 ppp1"
#
#wait_interface="ppp0"
