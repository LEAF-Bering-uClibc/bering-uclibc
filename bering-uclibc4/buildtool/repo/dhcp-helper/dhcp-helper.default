# Option flags used to start dhcp-helper.
#
# You will need at least "-s <DHCP server>" or
# "-b <interface> so that dhcp-helper knows where 
# to relay DHCP requests. 
#
# Example. Forward requests on eth1 to a server at 192.168.1.254
# DHCPHELPER_OPTS="-i eth1 -s 192.168.1.254"
#
DHCPHELPER_OPTS="-b eth0"
