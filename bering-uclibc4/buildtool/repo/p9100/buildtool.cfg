		Help <<EOF
		LEAF implementation of p910nd, a small printer daemon that does
		not spool to disk but passes the job directly to the printer.
		Homepage: http://etherboot.sourceforge.net/p910nd/
		LEAF package by __PACKAGER__, __BUILDDATE__

		The daemon is compiled with libwrap support, make sure that
		/etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny are setup correct.
		
		Source code of p910nd is written by Ken Yap of Australia.
		Compiled and assembled for LRP by Nicholas Fong of Canada.
		Variable PIDFILE was changed from /var/lock/subsys/p910%cd
		to /var/lock/p910%cd due to some issues in LRP startup scripts.

		This is a stand alone appliance which is a JetDirect EX clone,
		well, almost clone since it only implements the raw socket API
		TCP/IP print protocol, other protocols, such as
		RFC1179 LPD, IPX/SPX, DLC/LLC, Ethertalk, Appletalk, NETBEUI, NETBIOS
		and apps like telnet, ftp tftp, flash ROM upgrade, http
		are complete absent. But all you need is one good protocol.
