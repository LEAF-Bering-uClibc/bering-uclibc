# This file is parsed as a shell script
# Kernel command line parameters are available as KCMD_<variable>
# ie: KCMD_LRP contains the LRP= portion of the kernel command line
# NOTE: For kernel command line settings that do not include an equals
# sign (ie: rw or similar), the variable is set to itself, allowing
# for easy testing (ie: KCMD_rw=rw).

# LRP and PKGPATH variables now support whitespace (space, tab, newline)
# as well as commas for seperators.

# Uncomment for more verbose execution.
#VERBOSE=1

# Other variables you might want to set in this file include:
# LRP		Packages to load
# PKGPATH	Device(s) to load packages from
# CONFIGDB	Configuration database
# MODDB		Modules database
# syst_size	Size of / (root) ramdisk (Default is 40 MB)
# tmp_size	Size of /tmp ramdisk (Default is 50% of physical RAM)
# log_size	Size of /var/log ramdisk (Default is 3 MB)
# zswap_size    Size of 'swap' ramdisk (Default is auto size)
#               (-1 to disable, 0 auto size = sum of ramdisk sizes, or fixed size in MB)
