#
# UPnPd		linux-igd ported for leaf
#
# Uncomment these to change defaults.
#
# The current implemetation of UPNPD is capable of dealing with just one
# internal interface (where we listen for control messages) and one external
# interface (where firewall rules are managed).
#
# IF_INTERNAL="eth1"
# IF_EXTERNAL="ppp0"

# By default, we'll add a route for the multicast packets out the
# internal interface.  If you set MC_ROUTE to "", no route will be
# added/managed.
#
# MC_ROUTE="224.0.0.0/4"
